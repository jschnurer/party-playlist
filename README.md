# Party Playlist

You want to hang out with friends and listen to some YouTube music. Sure, easy. But you want your friends to be able to add songs from their own devices to the playlist. Well that's a little harder.

Party Playlist is the solution.

On the device connected to speakers, visit Party Playlist and create a Party Room. Each room has a unique 5-digit code to identify it.

Now everyone else at the party can visit Party Playlist and join the room using the 5-digit code. Party participants can see what's currently playing, what's up next, and they can search YouTube and add videos to the playlist. No app necessary.
